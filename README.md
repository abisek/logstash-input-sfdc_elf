# Logstash Plugin for Salesforce's Event Log File

The Salesforce Event Log File [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/logstash-input-sfdc_elf/) plug-in simplifies the integration between 
the ELK stack and Event Log Files by allowing you to easily download and index Salesforce event data every day without a custom integration.

ELF on ELK on Docker is the quickest way to get started. Check the links below.
